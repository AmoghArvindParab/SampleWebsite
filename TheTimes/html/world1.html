        <span class="location">Las Vegas &#45; </span>Donald Trump notched a resounding win in the Nevada caucuses Tuesday, 
        channeling the roiling anger of Republican voters against the establishment 
        and sweeping almost every category of the electorate to build his dominance in the delegate count. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a stunning show of momentum for his campaign, one that made it 
        increasingly difficult to imagine a scenario where any other GOP candidate wins the Republican nomination.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We love Nevada," Trump said during his brief victory speech 
        at his party in Las Vegas late Tuesday night. "We will be celebrating for a long time tonight."
      </p>
      <p>
        "We weren't expected to win too much and now we're winning, winning, winning the country," Trump said. 
        "And soon the country is going to start winning, winning, winning."
      </p>
      <p>
        He basked in his success across demographics.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We won the evangelicals," he said. "We won with young. With won with old. We won with highly educated. 
        We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated."
      </p>
      <p>
        On Wednesday morning, he looked ahead to a Trump presidency, detailing the three things he'd do on Day 1 if he wins the White House.
      </p>
      <p>
        "First thing is knock out some of the executive orders done by our president," Trump told George Stephanopoulos on ABC's "Good Morning America."
      </p>
      <p>
        "One, on border where people can pour into (the) country like Swiss cheese. I would knock out Obamacare. 
        Take care of our vets and military," the billionaire businessman said.
      </p>
      <h2>Narrow battle for second</h2>
      <p>
        Not only was it a win in the Silver State, but it was a win with a huge margin. With all of the expected vote in, 
        Trump dominated the race with 45.9%. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz featured in another tight battle for second, 
        with Rubio claiming 23.9% of the vote and Cruz 21.4%.
      </p>
      <p>
        The results in Nevada, a state where 30 delegates are at stake, demonstrated the power of Trump's appeal in this anti-establishment year. 
        It also underscored his ability to use his media savvy and enormous popularity to 
        sweep a state with complex caucus rules and where rivals were far more organized.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trump increased his vote share over what he won in other primary states, outpacing second place finisher Marco Rubio by double digits, 
        even though Rubio spent part of his childhood in Nevada.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rubio, however, insisted Wednesday morning that "a majority of Republican voters in this country do not want Donald Trump to be the nominee."
      </p>
      <p>
        Rubio attributed Trump's continued dominance of the GOP field to the fractured crowd of alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Until there's some consolidation here, you're not going to have a clear alternative to Donald Trump," he said on Fox News' "Fox and Friends." 
        "If we don't come together, we're never going to be able to provide a clear alternative to the direction that Donald Trump wants 
        to take the Republican Party and the country."
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most surprising aspects of Trump's win was that entrance polls showed he was winning among Latino 
        GOP caucus-goers even though he has campaigned on a hard-line immigration platform, including building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entrance polls indicated Latino caucusgoers made up 8% of the GOP electorate and 45% of them planned to back Trump. 
        Historically, however, entrance and exit polls have not proved to be a reliable measure when it comes to the preferences 
        of minority voters, particularly when the sample size was as small as it was in Nevada.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, Trump noted his showing among Latino Republicans in his victory speech: "Number one with Hispanics... I'm really happy about that," he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Driving Trump's victory were caucusgoers who said they wanted a president from outside the political establishment. 
        While Trump played up support among Latino GOP caucusgoers, the electorate was primarily white&ndash;accounting for 84% of those who turned out to caucus. 
        Some 6 in 10 caucusgoers said they were angry about the way the government is functioning.
